# Forum App

A simple forum app. My first foray into full-stack web development using the MERN stack.

## Features

- CRUD functionality of posts (both frontend and backend)
- Like and comment functionality
- User authentication using JSON Web Token
- Clean and usable UI

## Stack and Framework used

- Frontend: ReactJS, Redux, React-Router, Tailwind CSS, FlowBite UI
- Backend: NodeJS, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Testing: Jest, Cypress

## Upcoming Features

- Fix up some user interfaces (I have trouble with CSS :/)
- Dockerfile and automated CI/CD
- Markdown support for posts
- Abilty to like and unlike posts (user-unique likes, it's currently anonymous now)
- User-based commenting
- Better and more secure user authentication
